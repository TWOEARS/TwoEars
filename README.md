Two!Ears Auditory Model
=======================

**A computational framework for modelling active exploratory listening that
assigns meaning to auditory scenes**

The Two!Ears Auditory Model consists of several stages for modeling active human
listening. These stages include not only classical signal driven processing
steps like you can find in the [Auditory Modeling
Toolbox](http://amtoolbox.sourceforge.net/). It comes also with a complete
acoustical simulation framework for creating binaural ear signals for specified
acoustical scenes. The classical auditory signal processing is further
accompanied by a blackboard architecture that allows top-down processing and
the inclusion of world knowledge to the model.

The actual release of the model is available at its official [release
page](http://twoears.aipa.tu-berlin.de/download).  For an extensive
documentation on how to install and use the model have a look at its [online
documentation](http://docs.twoears.eu).
